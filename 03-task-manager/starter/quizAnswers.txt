1.  Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.
    - Middleware is used in an Express application to execute incoming HTTP requests.
     Every middleware function has access to the request and respond objects. 
     The middleware function sits in-between the request and response. 
     As a request comes in, the middleware will perform its functionality, and then send out the response. 
     The middleware function is assessed through the method app.use( ) and passed through the parameter/argument of a function. 
     It then must be followed by the function next( ) to continue on to the next middleware or else the cycle will be terminated. 
     Put simply we pass the middleware, express supplies the function, and then we pass the middleware as arguments to access them.

2. What does CRUD stand for?

4.How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your github repository?
